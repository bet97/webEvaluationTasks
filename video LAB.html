  <h1>Host Marked (DK)</h1>

<h2>Analysis of the web</h2>
<p>Videos in this web aren't used as a source of information; they are
acting as images that move and compliment the website. Videos are scenic and if we were to take screenshots of the website we don't have to wait
for a perfect moment as every frame of the video is pictureseque.</p>

<p>First video on the page has a little timer in the bottom left corner which is a nice touch and it makes user to watch the whole video as it's not very long.</p>

<p>While scrolling through the web I came across a video which was overlined with a box of text, I found it hard to concentrate on the text
  as the video was disturbing me from the reading. Scenes are shot in slow motion but the edit of the video is quite fast which is probably the reason
why I couldn't concentrate.</p>

<p>Climate change is the serious problem and one of the main reason for it is the unethical food production.
Tomatoes from Spain, bannanas from Ecuador, carbon footprint of the fruit and vegitables is huge and it is importnat
to support local market. That is why I feel this web is appropriate for my debate topic.</p>

<h1>Seafood from Norway</h1>

<h2>Analysis of the web</h2>

<p>Every page of the web features a slow motion shot of the fish that the page is dedicated to.
It is a nice complimentary feature to the heading and images on the web.</p>
<p>Videos are embeded through either vimeo or YouTube. First 35s of each video are exactly the same.
When I was watching them I thought they are all the same and I didn't have any motivation to finish
watching them. I found it odd that every video is the same I forwarded them and found out that the end of
each video is different and features the fish that the page is dedicated to.
However, if I was a normal page visitor I wouldn't watch them till the end.</p>

<p>The content of the videos depicts hard Norweigan life in cold and windy environment.
   This should be appealing to the potentional customers. Nevertheless, it is hard to watch the video
   till the end as every one of them starts the same.
</p>

<p>Seafood is heavily affected by global warming and climate change. Oceans and seas are getting warmer with every year.
Commercial fishing is endangered, especially small companies. Moreover, fishes
are endagered too as they need cold water environment to survive.</p>
